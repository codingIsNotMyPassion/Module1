Explain the below how it works

explain.html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <body>
        <script src=”script.js”></script>
        </body>
        </html>
script.js
        alert("I'm JavaScript!");
        alert('Hello') // this line is not having semicolon
        alert(`Wor
        ld`)
        alert(3 +1
        + 2); // this is multiple line code and its working

ANSWER:
first alert will ork as it is a string

second will work because semicolon is a good practice 
but javascript accepts without semicolon

Third alert is also a string with templete string literal

fourth alert also works after arthmetic operation
